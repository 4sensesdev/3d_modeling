# Let's play with 3D modeling!

<br>

<div style="text-align: justify">

The other day, I was "watching" the remake of one of the games that I played the most as a child and I saw that many people on the internet were wondering where this game could be located and after a consensus was reached, I chose that supposed location for this 3D modeling exercise, finding that it is a very interesting place and it is definitely one of the places that I want to visit in the future,  not because of the video game, but because of what I learned doing this exercise.

_Animation 1_

<div style="text-align: justify">

In this first animation this location is presented based on its similarity with what is shown in the game by consensus on internet posts, here I took the liberty of putting one of the most iconic phrases of this game since I am curious how people on the internet take the time to propose and debate these topics.

_Animation 2_

The second animation presents the Grand groups of soils present in this location according to FAO/UNESCO 2007, where it is shown that the dominant soils are the Humic Cambisols (Other Cambisols having an umbric A horizon which is thicker than 25 cm when a cambic B horizon is lacking) and the Calcic Cambisols (Other Cambisols showing one or more of the following:  a calcic horizon or a gypsic horizon or concentrations of soft powdery lime within 125 cm of the surface when the weighted average textural class is coarse, within 90 cm for medium textures, within 75 cm for fine textures; calcareous at least between 20 and 50 cm from the surface). This is in line with what you see in the first animation, a mountain landscape with a lot of green, which leads us to the next animation.

_Animation 3_

<div style="text-align: justify">

In the third animation we can see the landcover according to FAO/UNESCO where they show us what could already be inferred with the other two animations, a predominantly forest use, a small agricultural part and mixed areas which makes sense with this type of soil, the mountainous relief and the amount of green that is observed in the first animation.

**As a conclusion** it can be said that these people on the internet are geniuses, they managed to identify a region where forestry activity predominates with certain towns interconnected by areas of small agricultural use, it may be in these mixed areas where the population centers are located and all this is shown in the game, both in the original and the remake.

But leaving aside the game and the internet posts, with what I discovered in this exercise of 3D models, this location seems quite interesting, it would be fun to know what is grown there, what people live in these interconnected villages, surely tourism there can be fun and quiet with very good views of the horizon.

For those who haven't yet recognized this game, I allow myself to inform you that you need to play more, this is a classic one for some people. Getting out of the routine and doing other things that generate well-being benefit health and allow creativity to flow. Not everything can be hard work without distractions.

The goal of this exercise was to learn 3D modeling using well-known and easily accessible software, to present interesting information while also having fun. The idea is to show that learning and enjoyment can go hand in hand.

## Software used:
-	**QGIS** 
_(it is recommended to use the latest versions)_

### Plugins 
Here the idea is that you use what you consider appropriate:
- One for viewing satellite or topographic maps from various sources. 
<!-- OSMDownloader -->
- One to download DEM (not necessary if you already have a DEM downloaded from the internet). <!-- OpenTopography DEM Downloader-->
- One to visualize the layers and that allows you to combine the image with the DEM of the area (QGIS already does under the 3D Map View tool). <!-- Qgis2threejs -->
<!--
-There are a lot of videos on YouTube that show how to do cool things with these plugins
-To show these .gif first you had to make a video and then convert it to .gif but for that there are many explanations and tutorials on the internet.
-->
Remember, here everything necessary will be said so that you can replicate these things, but the complete information will only be visible to those who give freedom to their curiosity!

## Methodology
The layers of the desired geometry, the DEM and the satellite map of the selected source are loaded, proceed to open either the plugin or the 3D view, go to the configuration and there choose to place the DEM so that the 3D object will take the elevation and assign an extrusion multiplier to make the elevation changes in the 3D model more visible,  Finally save the file as an image or as the plugin allows (.gltf) the latter can be opened without problems with Windows10 by double-clicking on the file.

## Final Words
For those who wonder why make these 3D models, it happens that a while ago, I found a technical test that asked for high programming, creation of Apps, and where one of the points was supposedly "to know the skills to generate 3D models" specifically using Blender or Unreal Engine, but to participate, deliver codes, finished products and all related derivatives was required, test for applicants who have recently graduated from specific careers (careers in which this type of software is not shown even in the elective component) all this to compete for a single position. 
 
The test does not specify the destination of the products created by applicants who are not selected. However, it is easy to draw conclusions about where all that material will end up. Imagine that many candidates take this test, how many "free" products do the creators of the test collect? This kind of "magic" isn't even seen in the Harry Potter films.

To those who conduct calls and tests demanding unusual or overly specific requirements that segregate or limit access based on social or economic conditions, and who only do so to obtain codes, supplies, and/or finished products, I can only say,  _**"Here's a 3D just for you, if you know what I mean!"**_ There are better ways to evaluate candidate talent.

### **_Thank you to everyone who has read this far, except for those who design unfairly exclusionary tests. For you, there is nothing._**
